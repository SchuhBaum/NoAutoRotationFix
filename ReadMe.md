## NoAutoRotationFix
###### Version: 0.0.2

This is a mod for Elden Ring.

### Description
In Elden Ring v1.10 the camera rotates slightly every time you move your character left or right. Unless you have used the mouse in the last 3 seconds or so. This happens even when the option `Auto Rotation` is disabled.

See this youtube video for a demonstration:
